About project
=========================

"My christmas" is a place where people can share stories about their last christmas and New Year holidays, or any other outstanding day and comment&rate other people's stories. It's possible to attach story to one of predefined themes such as "How i celebrated", "Gifts i've got", "Gifts i've presented to others", as well as create your own theme. Every guest can like or dislike someone else's story and so we can display "top"s of most popular/unpopular stories.
